When I send a POST request to the '/products' endpoint with a new product object, I'm getting a 201 Created response, which is expected. However, the returned object doesn't include the product ID, making it difficult to track and update later.\n\nCould you please clarify if this is the intended behavior? If so, is there another way to retrieve the ID of the newly created product?\n\nThanks,\nJohn Doe",

    "message_body": "Hi Aetheros Support Team,\n\nI'm writing to suggest an improvement for the Mercury language regarding its integration with your Cloud Management services.\n\nWhile Mercury significantly streamlines API development, I believe it could be even more powerful with tighter integration with your cloud management offerings. Specifically, it would be incredibly beneficial if we could directly manage and provision cloud resources from within Mercury code.\n\nFor example, imagine being able to define and deploy a serverless function entirely within a Mercury script, including resource allocation, scaling configuration, and security settings. This would significantly streamline our development workflow and reduce the need for context switching between different tools and environments.\n\nI understand this might be a significant undertaking, but I believe it would greatly enhance the value proposition of both Mercury and your Cloud Management platform. I would be happy to discuss this further and provide more specific examples if needed.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nSincerely,\nJohn Doe",
