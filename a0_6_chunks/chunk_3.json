We're using your cloud management and API development services. \n\nCould you please look into this urgently? We believe our scaling configuration might need adjustment to handle the increased load. \n\nRegards,\nJohn Doe",

It would be incredibly helpful if we could see a real-time graph of our API usage directly on the main dashboard. This would provide us with instant visibility into any spikes or drops in traffic and allow us to correlate that data with other cloud resource metrics. \n\nThanks,\nJohn Doe",

It would be great if the dashboard could include a customizable widget for displaying average response times for selected APIs over a specific time period. This would provide a quick and easy way to monitor the performance of critical APIs.\n\nThanks for considering my suggestion.\n\nSincerely,\nJohn Doe",
