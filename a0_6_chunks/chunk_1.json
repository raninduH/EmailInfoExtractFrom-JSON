While I find it incredibly powerful for streamlining API development, I believe the error handling could be enhanced.\n\nCurrently, the error messages can be a bit cryptic, making it challenging to pinpoint the exact issue, especially when working with complex API interactions. It would be extremely helpful if error messages could be more verbose and provide clear guidance on resolving the issue.\n\nFor example, including line numbers, relevant code snippets, and potential solutions within error messages would significantly speed up debugging. \n\nThank you for considering my suggestion. I believe this improvement would make Mercury even more developer-friendly.\n\nSincerely,\nJohn Doe"
