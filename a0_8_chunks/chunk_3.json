While I appreciate the simplicity of the current error system, I believe it could benefit from more detailed error messages and potentially different error types. This would greatly assist in debugging and troubleshooting API issues. \n\nFor instance, when an API call fails, it would be helpful to receive an error message that not only indicates the general failure but also specifies the reason, such as invalid input parameters, database connection issues, or authentication problems. Different error types for these scenarios would make it easier to write targeted error handling code.\n\nI believe this enhancement would significantly improve the developer experience and make Mercury even more powerful for building robust and reliable APIs.\n\nThanks,\nJohn Doe"
