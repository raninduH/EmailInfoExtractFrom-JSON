It would be incredibly beneficial if the IAM service supported a more granular approach to role inheritance.

We then have a 'Senior Developer' role that needs all the permissions of a 'Developer' but with additional access, say, to production logs.\n\nWith a more granular inheritance model, we could assign only the necessary permissions to the 'Developer' role and then selectively inherit and add permissions for the 'Senior Developer' role.
