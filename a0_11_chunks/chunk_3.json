We have been impressed with the overall functionality, but have identified a potential improvement area.\n\nCurrently, we haven't found a streamlined way to automatically inherit roles for cloud resources based on their parent resource. For example, if a user has a specific role assigned at the project level, it would be efficient if those permissions automatically applied to any resources created within that project.\n\nImplementing a feature like this would significantly reduce manual configuration and potential for errors, simplifying our overall access management strategy.\n\nWe believe this enhancement would greatly benefit users like us who heavily rely on your services for granular and efficient cloud resource management.\n\nThank you for considering this suggestion.\n\nSincerely,\nIsiah Von",

However, we've noticed that the default alert threshold for latency spikes is a bit too sensitive for our use case. We often receive alerts for minor spikes that don't necessarily indicate a real issue.\n\nIt would be great if you could consider adding an option to customize the latency spike alert threshold. This would allow us to fine-tune the sensitivity and reduce the number of false positives we receive.\n\nThank you for considering this suggestion.\n\nSincerely,\nJohn Doe"
