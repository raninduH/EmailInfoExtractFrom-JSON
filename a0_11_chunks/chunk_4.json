While I appreciate the flexibility of the current system, I believe a more streamlined approach, perhaps inspired by Rust's Result type, would significantly enhance code readability and reduce boilerplate. \n\nAdditionally,  I've encountered some inconsistencies in how user roles with specific permissions are handled within the IAM service. Specifically, roles with read-only access to certain API endpoints seem to be granted write permissions intermittently. This has caused confusion and minor security concerns.\n\nCould you please look into these issues? \n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nSincerely,\nJohn Doe",
