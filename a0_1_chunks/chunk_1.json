Based on the information shared, we recommend exploring the following:\n\n1. **Instance Sizing:** Consider upgrading your 't2.medium' instances to a larger size like 'm5.large' or 'c5.large'. These offer increased CPU and memory resources, potentially resolving the latency issues during peak loads.\n\n2. **Autoscaling Implementation:** Implementing an autoscaling policy will allow your application to automatically adjust resources based on demand. You can configure it to add instances during peak hours (6 PM - 8 PM UTC) and remove them during off-peak periods for cost-effectiveness.\n\nWe can assist you with configuring the appropriate instance size and autoscaling policies. However, if you're comfortable managing these changes yourself, our documentation provides detailed guides:\n\n- [Instance Sizing Guide](https://example.com/docs/instance-sizing)\n- [Autoscaling Configuration](https://example.com/docs/autoscaling)\n\nPlease let us know if you have any further questions or need assistance with the implementation.\n\nBest regards,\nAetheros Support"

It would be incredibly helpful if the IAM service supported role inheritance, allowing us to create parent roles that automatically grant permissions to child roles.\n\nThis would greatly streamline our user management process and reduce the risk of human error. \n\nThank you for considering my suggestion.\n\nBest regards,\nJohn Doe"

It would be incredibly helpful if we could directly assign IAM roles to resources within the console interface. \n\nCurrently, we have to switch between the console and the IAM service to manage these roles. This integration would streamline our workflow and reduce the potential for errors. \n\nThank you for considering this suggestion.\n\nSincerely,\nIsabella Miller",
