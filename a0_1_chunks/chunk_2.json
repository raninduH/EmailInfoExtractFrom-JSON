    "message_body": "Our team is attempting to deploy a critical update to our production environment, but we are encountering a persistent issue related to an IAM role and a security group managed through Aetheros Cloud. \n\nThe deployment process is failing because the IAM role assigned to our application instances does not have the necessary permissions to access resources within the designated security group. \n\nWe have verified that the security group is configured correctly and the necessary ingress rules are in place. However, the IAM role still does not seem to have the required permissions to access resources within the security group. \n\nThis is a high-priority issue as it is preventing us from deploying essential updates to our production environment. We require immediate assistance to resolve this problem and get our deployment back on track.\n\nPlease let us know what steps need to be taken to resolve this issue as soon as possible."
