When I try to use the 'await' keyword, the code seems to be executing sequentially rather than asynchronously. This is causing significant performance issues in my application.\n\nI've tried reviewing the documentation and searching your forums, but haven't found a solution yet. Could you please help me understand what I might be doing wrong?\n\nHere's a snippet of the code I'm using:\n\n```mercury\nlet response = await http.get(\"https://example.com/api/data\");\nlog(response);\n```\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks,\nJohn Doe"

While the real-time monitoring is useful, it would be incredibly helpful if you could implement a customizable alerting system that triggers based on specific thresholds or patterns in the API response data.\n\nFor instance, being able to set an alert for when a specific endpoint's response time exceeds a defined limit or if a particular error code appears frequently would be extremely beneficial for proactive issue identification and resolution.\n\nThanks for considering this suggestion.\n\nSincerely,\nJohn Doe",
