It would be incredibly helpful if we could customize the timeframes for these charts. For instance, being able to see resource usage for the past 6 hours or 3 days would be beneficial for our real-time optimization efforts.\n\nThanks for considering this suggestion.\n\nBest regards,\nJohn Doe",

    "message_body": "Hi Aetheros Support Team,\n\nI've been using your API monitoring service for a few months now, and overall I'm happy with it. However, I have a suggestion that I believe would greatly improve the user experience.\n\nCurrently, the dashboard feels a bit cluttered and overwhelming, especially when dealing with a large number of APIs. It would be fantastic if you could implement a customizable dashboard where we can choose which metrics and graphs are displayed prominently.\n\nFor example, I'd love to be able to prioritize response time graphs for my critical APIs and have them front and center, while moving less important metrics to a secondary view.\n\nThank you for considering my suggestion. I believe this improvement would make a significant difference in the usability of your already excellent API monitoring service.\n\nSincerely,\nJohn Doe",
