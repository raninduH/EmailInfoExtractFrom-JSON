Specifically, we're facing challenges with:\n\n1. **Data Type Compatibility:** Our existing system relies heavily on custom data structures. We're struggling to find clear documentation on how to seamlessly map these structures with Mercury's native data types.\n2. **Error Handling:** The error messages we're receiving during compilation and runtime are quite cryptic. It's difficult to pinpoint the root cause of the errors and debug them efficiently.\n\nWe're hoping for some guidance and potential solutions to these problems. Our project timeline is tight, so any assistance you can provide would be greatly appreciated.\n\nBest regards,\nJohn Doe\nLead Developer, XYZ Corp",

While the current dashboard provides a good overview, I believe adding the following features would greatly enhance its usability:\n\n1. **Customizable Time Range Presets:** It would be very helpful to have the ability to set custom time range presets (e.g., last 30 minutes, last 6 hours) beyond the default options.\n2. **API Grouping and Filtering:**  With a large number of APIs being monitored, it becomes difficult to navigate and find specific data. Implementing API grouping and advanced filtering options would be highly beneficial.\n3. **Alert Threshold Visualization:** Visually representing alert thresholds directly on the performance graphs would provide a clearer understanding of API health at a glance.\n\nI believe these enhancements would significantly improve the user experience and provide greater insights into API performance.\n\nThank you for considering my suggestions.\n\nSincerely,\nJohn Doe"
