While I appreciate the overall efficiency of Mercury for API development, I believe the syntax for handling asynchronous calls could be made more intuitive.\n\nCurrently, managing callbacks and promises feels a bit cumbersome. Perhaps incorporating async/await syntax, similar to other modern languages, could significantly streamline this process and improve code readability.\n\nWould you consider implementing such a feature in future versions of Mercury?\n\nThanks,\nJohn Doe",

I believe adding support for async/await functionality would greatly improve the language's ability to handle asynchronous operations in a more readable and maintainable way.\n\nMany modern languages offer this feature, and it has become a standard for writing asynchronous code. Implementing async/await in Mercury would make it easier for developers to write efficient and performant APIs, especially when dealing with I/O-bound operations.\n\nI believe this addition would make Mercury even more powerful and attractive to developers. I look forward to your thoughts on this suggestion.\n\nSincerely,\nJohn Doe",

While the current dashboard provides a good overview, I believe it would be immensely helpful to have the ability to set up custom alert thresholds for specific API endpoints.\n\nCurrently, we have to rely on the general alert settings, which can be noisy and not granular enough for our needs.  Being able to define specific thresholds for latency, error rates, and other metrics on a per-endpoint basis would significantly enhance our ability to proactively monitor and react to potential issues.\n\nThank you for considering this suggestion. I believe this enhancement would greatly benefit many Aetheros users.\n\nSincerely,\nJohn Doe",
