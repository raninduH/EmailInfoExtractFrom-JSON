It provides robust tools to set and manage rate limits directly, without needing to build them from scratch within your Mercury code.\n\nYou can find more information about setting up rate limits with our API monitoring service in our knowledge base here: [link to documentation]\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.\n\nBest regards,\nThe Aetheros Support Team"
