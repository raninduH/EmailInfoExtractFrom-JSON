While Mercury significantly streamlines API development, I believe incorporating a more robust and standardized error handling mechanism would greatly benefit developers.\n\nCurrently, error handling in Mercury feels a bit fragmented. It would be incredibly helpful if the language could provide built-in functionalities or conventions for:\n\n* Defining custom error types specific to our API domain.\n* Handling exceptions in a more structured way, perhaps using try-catch blocks or similar constructs.\n* Generating consistent error responses across different API endpoints.\n\nThis enhancement would not only make our APIs more resilient but also simplify debugging and error tracking. It would contribute to a more developer-friendly experience when working with Mercury for API development.\n\nThank you for considering my suggestion. I'm eager to hear your thoughts on this and discuss it further.\n\nSincerely,\nJohn Doe",

    "message_body": "Hi Aetheros Support Team,\n\nI'm writing to suggest a new feature for your API development services. It would be incredibly beneficial if you could add support for WebSockets.\n\nAs real-time data becomes more crucial for our web application, we're finding that traditional HTTP requests are not sufficient for our needs. WebSockets would allow us to build real-time features like live chat, notifications, and collaborative tools directly into our application.\n\nI understand that adding support for a new technology like WebSockets can be a significant undertaking. Still, I believe it would be a valuable addition to your already impressive suite of services.\n\nThank you for considering my suggestion.\n\nSincerely,\nIsabella Williams"

We are not receiving any new data or alerts, making it impossible to monitor our API performance effectively.\n\n2. **Cloud Instance Unresponsive:** One of our cloud instances managed by Aetheros has become unresponsive. We cannot access the instance or any of the applications hosted on it.\n\nThese issues are severely impacting our operations. Please investigate and provide an update as soon as possible.\n\nSincerely,\nJohn Doe"
