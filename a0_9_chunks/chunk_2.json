It would be incredibly helpful if the error messages provided more context, such as:\n\n* The specific line number and file where the error occurred.\n* A stack trace to pinpoint the sequence of function calls leading to the error.\n* More descriptive error messages that clearly explain the root cause.\n\nThese improvements would significantly speed up debugging and enhance the overall developer experience. \n\nThank you for considering my suggestion.\n\nSincerely,\nJohn Doe",

There seems to be a possibility of overlapping roles, which is creating a significant security vulnerability in our system.\n\nSpecifically, we've found that users assigned to Role A are inadvertently gaining access to resources that should only be accessible to Role B. This overlap in permissions is a major concern, as it could potentially lead to unauthorized data access or even a data breach.\n\nWe need immediate assistance in addressing this issue. We're available to discuss this further and provide more details about our role configurations. Please treat this as extremely urgent.\n\nSincerely,\nKenneth Blake\nHead of IT, Davis-Jones Inc.",
