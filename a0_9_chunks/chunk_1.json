While I find it generally very powerful for API development, the error handling could be more robust.\n\nSpecifically, it would be incredibly helpful if error messages could provide more context about the location and cause of the error. For example, including the line number and a more detailed explanation within the error message itself would significantly speed up debugging.\n\nThank you for considering this suggestion. I believe it would make a big difference in the developer experience.\n\nSincerely,\nIsabella Davis"
