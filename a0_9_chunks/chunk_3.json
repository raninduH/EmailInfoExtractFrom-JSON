While the current feature set is robust, adding detailed activity logs and audit trails would greatly enhance security and compliance for our organization.\n\nSpecifically, we'd benefit from tracking actions like:\n\n* User logins (successful and failed)\n* Role assignments and changes\n* Permission modifications\n* API key generation and usage\n\nHaving a comprehensive log of these activities would allow us to:\n\n* Quickly identify and address potential security breaches\n* Meet regulatory compliance requirements for data access auditing\n* Gain deeper insights into user behavior and system usage patterns\n\nI believe this enhancement would be invaluable for many Aetheros customers and significantly strengthen your IAM offering.

The deployment requires more resources than your current plan allows. To proceed, you can either:\n\n1. Optimize your application to use fewer resources.\n2. Upgrade your plan to one with higher resource limits.\n\nYou can find details on our plans and their resources here: [link to pricing page]. If you choose to upgrade, you can do so directly from your Aetheros Cloud dashboard.\n\nPlease let us know if you have any further questions. \n\nSincerely,\nAetheros Support",
