Specifically, I'm dealing with a scenario where multiple requests might try to modify the same data simultaneously. \n\nCould you provide some guidance or examples on how to implement proper concurrency control in Mercury? Perhaps using mutexes or semaphores?\n\nThanks in advance for your help!\n\nBest,\nIsiah McDermott",

While it's quite robust, I find the process of setting up user role inheritance to be a bit complex. It would be great if there was a more streamlined approach, perhaps a visual interface for managing role hierarchies.\n\nThis would significantly simplify user management, especially in larger teams with complex role structures.\n\nThanks,\nJohn Doe"
