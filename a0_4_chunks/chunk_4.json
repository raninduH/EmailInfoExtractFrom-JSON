Async/await patterns have become a standard in many languages for writing asynchronous code that is easier to read, understand, and maintain compared to traditional callback-based approaches.\n\nImplementing async/await in Mercury would significantly improve developer productivity and code quality for applications built using your framework.  \n\nI'd be happy to discuss this suggestion further and provide more specific examples of how this feature could be implemented and the benefits it would bring.\n\nThanks,\nIsabella Davis",
