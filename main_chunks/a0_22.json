        "message_body": "Hi John,\n\nThank you for providing the code snippet. In Mercury, you can handle potential errors using the `match` expression. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```mercury\n// ... some code ...\nlet result = tryParseInt(userInput);\n\nmatch result {\n  Some(value) => // Use the parsed integer 'value'\n  None => // Handle the case where parsing failed\n}\n\n// ... rest of your code ...\n```\n\nThe `tryParseInt` function returns an `Option` type. If the parsing is successful, it returns `Some(value)`, where `value` is the parsed integer. If parsing fails, it returns `None`.\n\nYou can then use the `match` expression to handle both cases gracefully.\n\nPlease let us know if you have any further questions.\n\nBest regards,\nAetheros Support Team"

We understand your requirement for asynchronous processing to improve the performance of your application.  \n\nWe are currently developing a new set of features in Mercury Language that will directly address efficient asynchronous API handling. These features are expected to be rolled out in the next few weeks.\n\nIn the meantime, while not ideal, you could potentially achieve a similar outcome using multi-threading within your existing codebase. However, this approach might require more complex error handling and synchronization on your end.\n\nWe will keep you updated on the progress of the new asynchronous features in Mercury. Please let us know if you have any further questions.\n\nBest regards,\nThe Aetheros Support Team",
