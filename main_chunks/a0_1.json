Based on the information shared, we recommend exploring the following:\n\n1. **Instance Sizing:** Consider upgrading your 't2.medium' instances to a larger size like 'm5.large' or 'c5.large'. These offer increased CPU and memory resources, potentially resolving the latency issues during peak loads.\n\n2. **Autoscaling Implementation:** Implementing an autoscaling policy will allow your application to automatically adjust resources based on demand. You can configure it to add instances during peak hours (6 PM - 8 PM UTC) and remove them during off-peak periods for cost-effectiveness.\n\nWe can assist you with configuring the appropriate instance size and autoscaling policies. However, if you're comfortable managing these changes yourself, our documentation provides detailed guides:\n\n- [Instance Sizing Guide](https://example.com/docs/instance-sizing)\n- [Autoscaling Configuration](https://example.com/docs/autoscaling)\n\nPlease let us know if you have any further questions or need assistance with the implementation.\n\nBest regards,\nAetheros Support"
