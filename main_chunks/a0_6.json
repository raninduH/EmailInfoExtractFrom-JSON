While I find it incredibly powerful for streamlining API development, I believe the error handling could be enhanced.\n\nCurrently, the error messages can be a bit cryptic, making it challenging to pinpoint the exact issue, especially when working with complex API interactions. It would be extremely helpful if error messages could be more verbose and provide clear guidance on resolving the issue.\n\nFor example, including line numbers, relevant code snippets, and potential solutions within error messages would significantly speed up debugging. \n\nThank you for considering my suggestion. I believe this improvement would make Mercury even more developer-friendly.\n\nSincerely,\nJohn Doe"

        "message_body": "Hi Aetheros Support Team,\n\nI'm writing to suggest an improvement for the Mercury language regarding its integration with your Cloud Management services.\n\nWhile Mercury significantly streamlines API development, I believe it could be even more powerful with tighter integration with your cloud management offerings. Specifically, it would be incredibly beneficial if we could directly manage and provision cloud resources from within Mercury code.\n\nFor example, imagine being able to define and deploy a serverless function entirely within a Mercury script, including resource allocation, scaling configuration, and security settings. This would significantly streamline our development workflow and reduce the need for context switching between different tools and environments.\n\nI understand this might be a significant undertaking, but I believe it would greatly enhance the value proposition of both Mercury and your Cloud Management platform. I would be happy to discuss this further and provide more specific examples if needed.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nSincerely,\nJohn Doe",
