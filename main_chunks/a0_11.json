We have been impressed with the overall functionality, but have identified a potential improvement area.\n\nCurrently, we haven't found a streamlined way to automatically inherit roles for cloud resources based on their parent resource. For example, if a user has a specific role assigned at the project level, it would be efficient if those permissions automatically applied to any resources created within that project.\n\nImplementing a feature like this would significantly reduce manual configuration and potential for errors, simplifying our overall access management strategy.\n\nWe believe this enhancement would greatly benefit users like us who heavily rely on your services for granular and efficient cloud resource management.\n\nThank you for considering this suggestion.\n\nSincerely,\nIsiah Von",

While I appreciate the flexibility of the current system, I believe a more streamlined approach, perhaps inspired by Rust's Result type, would significantly enhance code readability and reduce boilerplate. \n\nAdditionally,  I've encountered some inconsistencies in how user roles with specific permissions are handled within the IAM service. Specifically, roles with read-only access to certain API endpoints seem to be granted write permissions intermittently. This has caused confusion and minor security concerns.\n\nCould you please look into these issues? \n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nSincerely,\nJohn Doe",
