The monitoring dashboards are showing connection errors and timeouts, leading to inaccurate data and missed alerts.\n\nUpon investigation, we suspect a potential issue with the IAM roles and permissions assigned to our monitoring agents.  We recently updated some role definitions, and it's possible there was an unintended change impacting the agents' ability to authenticate and access API metrics.\n\nCould you please urgently investigate this issue and help us resolve the permission discrepancies?\n\nThanks,\nIsiah Schmeler",

However, we've identified an area where the user experience could be enhanced.\n\nCurrently, the API monitoring dashboard displays basic user information for API calls.  We propose adding a feature to display the IAM role associated with each API call directly on the dashboard. This would greatly streamline our debugging and security auditing processes by providing immediate context into the permissions and access levels associated with each API interaction.\n\nThank you for considering this suggestion. We believe this enhancement would significantly improve the usability and value of your platform.\n\nSincerely,\nKenneth Flores",
