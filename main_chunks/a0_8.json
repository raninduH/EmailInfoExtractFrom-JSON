It would be incredibly beneficial if the IAM service supported a more granular approach to role inheritance. Currently, we have situations where a child role inherits all permissions from the parent role, which isn't always ideal.\n\nFor instance, we might have a 'Developer' role that needs access to specific cloud resources for development purposes. We then have a 'Senior Developer' role that needs all the permissions of a 'Developer' but with additional access, say, to production logs.\n\nWith a more granular inheritance model, we could assign only the necessary permissions to the 'Developer' role and then selectively inherit and add permissions for the 'Senior Developer' role. This would significantly improve security and management within our organization.\n\nCould you consider implementing a more fine-grained role inheritance feature in the IAM service?\n\nThanks,\nJohn Doe"

Currently, managing roles and permissions is straightforward, but it would be incredibly helpful if the IAM service supported role inheritance.\n\nFor example, let's say we have a 'developer' role and a 'senior developer' role.  It would be much more efficient if 'senior developer' could inherit all permissions from the 'developer' role, and we could simply add any additional permissions needed.\n\nThis would significantly reduce the complexity and time spent on managing roles, especially in larger teams and projects. \n\nThank you for considering my suggestion.

Different error types for these scenarios would make it easier to write targeted error handling code.\n\nI believe this enhancement would significantly improve the developer experience and make Mercury even more powerful for building robust and reliable APIs.\n\nThanks,\nJohn Doe"
