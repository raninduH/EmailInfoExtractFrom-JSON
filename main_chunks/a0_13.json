Let's break down your questions:\n\n* **Defining Infrastructure in Mercury:** While you can't directly specify server sizes or regions within your Mercury code, we provide configuration files where you can define these environmental settings.\n* **Deployment Process:**  We have a dedicated command-line tool called `aedeploy` that seamlessly integrates with your Mercury projects. After configuring your deployment settings, you can use `aedeploy push` to deploy your API to the Aetheros Cloud.\n* **Resources:** You can find detailed information and a step-by-step guide on our documentation page: [Link to Aetheros Docs - Mercury Deployment](https://example.com/docs/mercury-deployment)\n\nPlease don't hesitate to reach back out if you have any more questions. \n\nBest regards,\nThe Aetheros Support Team"

We appreciate you taking the time to share your suggestion for enhanced activity logs and audit trails.\n\nWe understand the importance of comprehensive logging for security, compliance, and gaining deeper insights into user activity. We are happy to inform you that we are actively developing these features for our IAM service and plan to roll them out in phases over the coming months.\n\nThe first phase will focus on providing detailed logs for user login activities (successful and failed attempts). Subsequent phases will introduce logging for role assignments, permission changes, and API key management.\n\nWe will keep you updated on our progress and will announce the availability of these new features through our regular communication channels.\n\nIn the meantime, if you have any further suggestions or questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAetheros Support Team",
