Currently, the deployment process, while functional, feels a bit cumbersome and could benefit from some streamlining.\n\nSpecifically, I believe integrating automated resource provisioning based on the Mercury application's configuration files would significantly speed up deployment. This would allow developers to define their infrastructure needs directly within their code, making the deployment process smoother and less prone to manual errors.\n\nFurthermore, incorporating a feature within the Mercury language itself to specify deployment environments (e.g., development, staging, production) would be incredibly beneficial. This would enable developers to manage environment-specific configurations more efficiently and ensure consistent deployments across different stages.\n\nI believe these enhancements would greatly improve the developer experience and streamline the cloud deployment workflow for Mercury applications.\n\nThank you for considering my suggestions.\n\nSincerely,\nIsiah Schmeler",

Can you provide more specific documentation or examples on how inheritance is handled during delegation, especially in complex scenarios with multiple nested roles?\n\nAdditionally, we've noticed inconsistencies in the API monitoring logs regarding permission checks for delegated roles. It would be helpful if you could look into that as well.\n\nRegards,\nJohn",
