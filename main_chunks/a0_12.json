This would enable us to fine-tune the monitoring and receive more relevant alerts based on our specific performance expectations.\n\nFor example, certain Mercury functions might have varying execution times that differ from traditional APIs. Having the flexibility to adjust thresholds accordingly would significantly reduce false positives and enhance the overall effectiveness of the monitoring.\n\nThank you for considering this suggestion.

        "message_body": "Hello John,\n\nThank you for your interest in Mercury! We're happy to answer your questions about concurrency.\n\nMercury primarily utilizes a lightweight coroutine-based concurrency model. This allows for efficient asynchronous programming and avoids many of the complexities associated with traditional threading.\n\nTo manage shared resources and prevent race conditions, Mercury employs a data immutability principle. By default, data structures are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed after creation. This eliminates a major source of concurrency bugs.\n\nFor situations where shared mutable state is necessary, Mercury offers specific constructs and libraries that provide safe and controlled access. These mechanisms ensure data integrity and prevent common concurrency issues.\n\nWe are preparing a detailed document with code examples illustrating concurrency patterns in Mercury. We will send it to you within the next 24 hours.\n\nLet us know if you have any other questions.\n\nBest regards,\nThe Aetheros Support Team"

        "message_body": "Dear Isabella,\n\nThank you for your interest in Aetheros! We'd be happy to provide more information about our IAM service and how it can be used to manage access to your custom APIs.\n\nYou can achieve granular role-based access control (RBAC) with Aetheros by defining roles that permit access to specific API endpoints or methods. You can specify these permissions down to the HTTP method level (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).\n\nAetheros also allows you to leverage user attributes and other contextual information when defining access control policies. This enables you to create dynamic rules that adapt to different situations.\n\nRegarding role inheritance and conflicts, Aetheros uses a least privilege model. This means that users are only granted the permissions explicitly assigned to their roles. Inheritance is handled hierarchically, and any conflicts are resolved in favor of the most restrictive permission.\n\nWe are confident that Aetheros can provide the flexible and robust IAM solution you need. Please let us know if you have any further questions or would like to schedule a demo.\n\nBest Regards,\nThe Aetheros Support Team",

You're correct that while our IAM service allows for custom role creation, it doesn't currently support granular endpoint-level permissions for APIs. \n\nWe understand this is an important feature for many of our users, and we are actively working on implementing more fine-grained API access control in a future update to our platform.\n\nIn the meantime, a potential workaround could be to implement additional authorization logic within your API application itself. This would involve checking the user's role within the API code and allowing or denying access to specific endpoints based on your internal logic.\n\nWe apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your patience as we continue to improve our services.

We are confident the error lies within the latest compiler update, as this code worked seamlessly before the upgrade.\n\nPlease advise on any potential solutions or workarounds. Our production environment remains down, and we're eager to get it back up and running.\n\nBest regards,\nJohn"

When a role is delegated, it only receives the explicitly granted permissions, not those inherited from other roles. \n\nTo further enhance security, we recommend following the principle of least privilege when assigning roles and permissions.

We appreciate you taking the time to share your feedback and use case with us.\n\nWe understand the need for more fine-grained control over role permissions, and we agree that it would enhance both security and management capabilities. We've been researching different approaches to implementing a more robust and flexible inheritance model.\n\nWe've added your suggestion to our feature request list and will prioritize it based on user demand and feasibility. While we cannot provide a specific timeline for implementation, we will keep you updated on any progress.\n\nIn the meantime, would you be open to a quick call to discuss your specific use case and explore potential workarounds within the existing IAM framework?\n\nBest Regards,\nThe Aetheros Support Team"
