        "message_body": "Dear John,\n\nThank you for providing the additional details. Based on the information you've shared, we recommend exploring the following optimization strategies:\n\n1. **Vertical Scaling:** Consider upgrading your m5.large instances to a more powerful instance type within the M5 family, such as m5.xlarge or m5.2xlarge. This can provide more CPU and memory resources to handle peak loads.\n2. **Auto Scaling:** Implement AWS Auto Scaling to dynamically adjust the number of instances based on real-time demand. You can configure Auto Scaling policies to automatically add instances during peak hours and remove them when traffic subsides.\n3. **Load Balancing:** Utilize AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) to distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances. This helps prevent any single instance from becoming overwhelmed and improves application availability.\n\nWe recommend testing these strategies in a staging environment before deploying them to production to ensure they meet your specific performance requirements.\n\nPlease let us know if you have any further questions or require additional assistance. We're here to help!\n\nBest regards,\nAetheros Support Team",

        "message_body": "Dear John,\n\nThank you for providing more context. You can achieve this using Mercury Language's built-in IAM capabilities. Please follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define Access Levels:** Navigate to the IAM settings within your Mercury Language console. Create two access levels: 'Production Deployment' and 'Module Modification'.\n2. **Assign Permissions:** Grant the 'Admin' role full access to both 'Production Deployment' and 'Module Modification' access levels. For the 'Developer' role, restrict access to both these levels.\n3. **Apply Restrictions:** In your Mercury Language code, use the `@authorize` decorator to protect sensitive functions and modules. For example, you can annotate deployment scripts with `@authorize(accessLevel='Production Deployment')` and critical modules with `@authorize(accessLevel='Module Modification')`.\n\nThis setup ensures that only users with the 'Admin' role can deploy to production or modify sensitive code sections. \n\nPlease let us know if you have any further questions.\n\nSincerely,\nThe Aetheros Support Team"

Here are the details you requested:\n\n* **Instance Types:** We're primarily using the standard C4 instances (4 vCPU, 8GB RAM) for our application servers.\n* **Autoscaling:** We have configured autoscaling to trigger when CPU utilization goes beyond 70%, with a maximum of 10 instances.\n* **Database:** We're using your managed PostgreSQL database service, with a 1TB standard storage plan.\n* **Traffic:** During peak hours (around 7 PM - 9 PM UTC), we get around 5,000 requests per minute.\n\nWe initially believed these settings would suffice, but the performance issues persist. We suspect there might be an issue with how our Mercury code interacts with the API during scaling events. Could you advise if there are any known limitations or best practices for handling such scenarios in Mercury?\n\nRegards,\nIsiah",

While we cannot promise immediate implementation, we will certainly consider it for future development plans.\n\nIn the meantime, please let us know if you have any other questions or suggestions.
