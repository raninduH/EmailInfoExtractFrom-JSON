Currently, it's a bit difficult to get a quick overview of the health of all APIs at a glance.\n\nIt would be fantastic if you could add a feature that displays a summary table on the main dashboard. This table could show the status (e.g., green for healthy, yellow for warning, red for critical) of each API we're monitoring, along with key metrics like average response time and error rate.\n\nThis would allow us to quickly identify any potential issues and dive into more detailed data if needed.\n\nThanks for considering my suggestion!\n\nSincerely,\nJohn Doe",

There seems to be a possibility of overlapping roles, which is creating a significant security vulnerability in our system.\n\nSpecifically, we've found that users assigned to Role A are inadvertently gaining access to resources that should only be accessible to Role B.

While Mercury significantly streamlines API development, I believe incorporating a more robust and standardized error handling mechanism would greatly benefit developers.\n\nCurrently, error handling in Mercury feels a bit fragmented. It would be incredibly helpful if the language could provide built-in functionalities or conventions for:\n\n* Defining custom error types specific to our API domain.\n* Handling exceptions in a more structured way, perhaps using try-catch blocks or similar constructs.\n* Generating consistent error responses across different API endpoints.\n\nThis enhancement would not only make our APIs more resilient but also simplify debugging and error tracking. It would contribute to a more developer-friendly experience when working with Mercury for API development.\n\nThank you for considering my suggestion. I'm eager to hear your thoughts on this and discuss it further.\n\nSincerely,\nJohn Doe",

It would be great if we could customize the dashboard widgets to display specific metrics relevant to our needs. For example, being able to create a widget that shows the average latency of a particular API endpoint over a custom timeframe.\n\nThis would greatly improve the platform's usability and allow us to focus on the metrics that matter most to us.\n\nThanks,\nJohn Doe"

It would be incredibly beneficial if you could add support for WebSockets.\n\nAs real-time data becomes more crucial for our web application, we're finding that traditional HTTP requests are not sufficient for our needs. WebSockets would allow us to build real-time features like live chat, notifications, and collaborative tools directly into our application.\n\nI understand that adding support for a new technology like WebSockets can be a significant undertaking. Still, I believe it would be a valuable addition to your already impressive suite of services.\n\nThank you for considering my suggestion.\n\nSincerely,\nIsabella Williams"
