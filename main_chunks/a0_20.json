Currently, we have separate roles for developers and viewers, with developers having more permissions to modify resources. With role inheritance, we could simply have the 'developer' role inherit all permissions from the 'viewer' role and add only the delta permissions needed. This would make our role management much cleaner and less prone to errors.\n\nAdditionally, we are planning to integrate our CI/CD pipeline with your API development and cloud management services. Having role inheritance would make it much easier to manage access for automated processes.\n\nI hope this provides more clarity on our use case. Let me know if you have any further questions.\n\nBest,\nJohn",
