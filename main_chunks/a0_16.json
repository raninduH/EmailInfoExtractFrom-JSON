We're happy to provide more information about Mercury and its integration with our IAM service.\n\nMercury simplifies RBAC implementation through its declarative syntax and built-in security features. You can define roles and permissions directly within your API code using annotations and decorators. These definitions are then enforced by the Aetheros runtime, ensuring that only authorized users can access specific API endpoints or resources.\n\nMercury provides dedicated libraries for interacting with the Aetheros IAM service. These libraries offer functions for retrieving user roles, checking permissions, and managing authentication tokens. This tight integration allows for streamlined RBAC implementation within your Mercury code.\n\nFor code examples and detailed documentation, please visit our documentation portal at [link to documentation]. You'll find a comprehensive guide on using Mercury and Aetheros IAM for secure API development.\n\nPlease don't hesitate to contact us if you have any further questions.\n\nBest regards,\nAetheros Support Team"
