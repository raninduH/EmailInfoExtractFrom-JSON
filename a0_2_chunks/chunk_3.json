This is causing our application to become slow and unresponsive for our users.\n2. **API Request Errors:**  We're encountering a high volume of 500 errors when making requests to our APIs developed with Aetheros. This started happening around the same time as the scaling issue.\n\nWe need urgent assistance in resolving these issues as they are significantly impacting our business. Please investigate this as soon as possible and let us know what steps we can take to address them.\n\nThank you,\nKenneth Anderson",
